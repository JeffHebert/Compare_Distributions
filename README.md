## Introduction

This simple Shiny app will help you visualize a gaussian distribution and several example data sets.

This app will allow you to visualize how mean and standard deviation parameters affect a theoretical distribution. In this case, we are working with the well known normal (or Gaussian) distribution. This app uses data that is available in the 'datasets' package which comes installed with base R. These distributions are choses to show how real-world data can somtimes fall within a normal distribution. Can you spot which sets are normally distributed?

The app is located at [jeffhebert.shinyapps.io/Compare_Distributions](https://jeffhebert.shinyapps.io/Compare_Distributions/)

Thank you for checking out my app!
